Packet loss or some other thing happens = Rollback buffer + 1 new inputs arrive simultaneously, unhalting:
Frame number desync = One sided rollback!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How to balance onesided?

Rollback to specified frame and re-read inputs 

Other things that can cause onesided rollback = framedrops
If both clients agree on delay duration, then the simulation time = Last recived input - delay time

Onesided rollbacks = One side gets huge delay other gets frequent rollbacks
