Intro:
Why have you done the study on it?

Centralised rollback?

\item{Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\cite{SSBU}}
\item{Granblue Fantasy Versus\cite{GBFV}}
\item{Under Night In-Birth\cite{UNI}
\item{Samurai Shodown\cite{SamSho}
\item{Soulcalibur VI\cite{SVI}}

Aims and Objectives
Aim: To investigate rollback netcode, it's  in industry and any short comings of existing rollback netcode infrastructure

Objectives:
1) Understand rollback netcode and the effects on the games it's implemented in
2) Explore the missing optimizations and issues in implementing rollback netcode in existing industry products
3) Create a visualization/implementation of rollback netcode to demonstrate more clearly the useage of rollback
4) Investigate further usages of rollback that can be applied elsewhere in the industry


What you did and how.
Games that have implemented first party rollback:
SFV, MK11, Skull girls, GGST, KI, BBCF, Tekken 7, Brawlhalla, Melty Blood type lumina
rocket league,

games that have had difficulty implementing rollback:
SFV, MK11, Tekken 7, Melty Blood type lumina

games that have added third party rollback:
Melee, third strike, MVC2, SF2T, KOF2002, Metal Slug X

Noteable games without:
GBFV, Smash Bros Ultimate, UNICLR, SAMSHO, Soulcalibur VI, GGxrd, DOA 6, EA Sports UFC 4, DBFZ

Difficulties of implmenting:
- separate gameplay from rendering
- serializable game state
- particle simulation 
- object lifetime 
- sound fx
- animation system
- UI
- desync detection

- one sided rollbacks
- optimization

Genres that rollback could apply to (and why/why not?):
Rollback ideas that only apply to fighting games? (Visual teleportation?, Expensive to implement?, ) 
Shooters (Need for visual consistency (shot around corner), existing soultion?) , RTS (Including sports games), MMO, RPG, Racing Games, 
researched GGPO

Devloped Unity game (Big)

Read existing rollback studies



Evaluation:
Re-evaluate objectives and soultions to them
