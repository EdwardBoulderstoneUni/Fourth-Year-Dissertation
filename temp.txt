Connections over the internet communicate data in packets which can run into the following issues.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Packets take time to reach their destination (Network Latency).}
\item{Packets can get lost on their way (Packet Loss).}
\item{Packets can get there, but have their data corrupted (Corruption).}
\item{Computers can run at different speeds.}
\item{Computers can occasionally get hung up on doing things and skip a frame or two.}
\end{itemize}
To alleviate the effect of network latency, input latency frames can be added. Input latency delays the inputs of both users by a number of frames, such that the packet containing a users inputs can be sent ahead of time, and if it arrives during the input latency time, the game is not required to be paused.
